# hangman
A simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer

First, the intro is written out. User is welcomed and told about basic rules of the game.
Then, word between 5 and 12 characters is randomly selected from a file.
Game should be played until player has guessed the secret word or has no more attempts.

There is a display of how many more incorrect guesses does the user have.
Also, correct letters are displayed like _ r o g r a _ _ i n g.
User is able to see what letters he already entered

At the start of any turn, instead of making a guess the player should also have the option to save the game
When the program first loads, there is an option that allows user to open one of his saved games, which should jump him exactly back to where he was when he saved.
